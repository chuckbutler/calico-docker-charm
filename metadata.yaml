  Calico can provide networking in a Docker environment. Each container gets
  its own IP, there is no encapsulation and it can support massive scale.
  Calico connects datacenter workloads (containers, VMs, or bare metal) via IP
  no matter which compute host they are on. Read about it on the
  [Project Calico website](http://www.projectcalico.org/).
  Endpoints are network interfaces associated with workloads.
